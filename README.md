# GenerativeModeling

A generative model includes the distribution of the data itself, and tells you how likely a given example is. For example, models that predict the next word in a sequence are typically generative models (usually much simpler than GANs) because they can assign a probability to a sequence of words.

A discriminative model ignores the question of whether a given instance is likely, and just tells you how likely a label is to apply to the instance.
